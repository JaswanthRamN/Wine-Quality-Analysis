# Wine-Quality-Analysis
## Project Overview  

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Wine Quality Data** using **Python and Pandas**. The dataset used in this analysis is **"red_wine.csv"**, which contains physicochemical properties of different red wine samples.

### Key Steps in the Analysis:
- **Loaded the dataset** and explored its structure (head, tail, and info).
- **Data Inspection**:
  - Checked for **missing values** and **data types**.
  - Analyzed the **distribution of wine quality scores**.
- **Feature Analysis**:
  - Identified key **chemical properties** affecting wine quality.
  - Examined **correlations** between attributes.
- **Visualization**:
  - Used **histograms, scatter plots, and box plots** to understand data distributions.
  - Plotted **correlation heatmaps** to identify relationships between variables.

This project helps in understanding the **factors that influence wine quality**, providing insights that can be useful for **winemakers and quality control processes**.
